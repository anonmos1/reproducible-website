      Several tools are now available to make your life easier when working on
      <em>reproducible builds</em>:

    <h2>diffoscope</h2>

  <div class="eight columns text">
    <p>
      <a href="https://diffoscope.org/">diffoscope</a> will try to <strong>get
      to the bottom of what makes files or directories different</strong>. It
      will recursively unpack archives of many kinds and transform various
      binary formats into more human readable forms for comparsion. It can
      compare two tarballs, ISO images, or PDFs just as easily.

    <p>
      Problems with <a href="/docs/stable-inputs/">unstable order of inputs</a>
      or other variations introduced by filesystems can sometimes be hard to track down.
      <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/disorderfs">disorderfs</a> is
      <strong>an overlay FUSE filesystem that introduces non-determinism into
      filesystem metadata</strong>. For example, it can randomize the order in
      which directory entries are read.

    <h2>strip-nondeterminism</h2>

  <div class="eight columns text">
    <p>
      Some tools used in build systems might introduce non-determinism in ways
      difficult to fix at the source, which <strong>requires
      post-processing</strong>. <a
      href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/strip-nondeterminism">strip-nondeterminism</a>
      knows how to <strong>normalize various file formats</strong> such as gzipped files, ZIP
      archives, and Jar files. It is written in Perl with extensibility in
      mind.
