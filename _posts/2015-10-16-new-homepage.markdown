While long considered nearly impossible for real software,
the idea of *reproducible builds* has been revived a couple years ago by
developpers from Bitcoin and The Tor Project. Since then, [several major free
software projects]({{ "/who/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) are now actively
working on supporting reproducible builds.

It was time to give more visibility to the various initiatives and get a common
ground to share general information, specifications, and tutorials. So here's a
new homepage!

**Everyone is welcome to contribute!** To get a copy of the website, just type:

    git clone https://reproducible-builds.org/website.git

Most of the currently available documentation has been written with the
experience and the perspective of the work done in the Debian project. We are
sure missing important research and solutions. Please share your insights!
