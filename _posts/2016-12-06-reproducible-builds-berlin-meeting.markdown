People from various projects interested in reproducible builds will meet again! Following the [December 2015 summit in Athens]({{ "/events/athens2015/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), the three day [event in Berlin]({{ "/events/berlin2016/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) welcomes previous attendees and new projects. The participants will discuss, connect and exchange ideas in order to grow the reproducible builds effort.

The exact content of the meeting will be shaped by the participants, but here are the main goals:

  * Update & exchange about the status of reproducible builds in various projects.
  * Improve collaboration both between and inside projects.
  * Expand the scope and reach of reproducible builds to more projects.
  * Work together and hack on solutions.
  * Brainstorm designs on tools enabling end-users to get the most benefits from reproducible builds.

Logs and minutes will be published after the meeting.

Please [reach out](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/berlin2016) if you'd like to participate in hopefully interesting, inspiring and intense technical sessions about reproducible builds and beyond!
