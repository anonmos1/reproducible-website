Like in [December 2015 in Athens](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/athens2015/), this year a group of people from various projects will [meet in Berlin](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/berlin2016/) for three days to discuss, connect and exchange ideas and grow the reproducible builds effort.

The exact content of the meeting will be shaped by the participants, but here are the main goals:

  * Update &amp; exchange about the status of reproducible builds in various projects.
  * Improve collaboration both between and inside projects.
  * Expand the scope and reach of reproducible builds to more projects.
  * Work together and hack on solutions.
  * Brainstorm designs on tools enabling end-users to get the most benefits from reproducible builds.

Logs and minutes will be published after the meeting.

Please [reach out](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/berlin2016) if you'd like to participate in hopefully interesting, inspiring and intense technical sessions about reproducible builds and beyond!
