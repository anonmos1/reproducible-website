### How else can I benefit from the work other distributions have put into making unreproducible upstream software reproducible?

Debian currently tracks notes and bugs on all unreproducible packages in this git repo: [https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/reproducible/notes.git/](https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/reproducible/notes.git/) They hope to extend this work to contain notes for the same source in different distributions in the near future.
